Dependencies
==================
Game depends on following libraries:

SDL: http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
SDL_gfx: http://freshmeat.net/projects/sdl_gfx/
SDL_image: http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
SDL_mixer: http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
SDL_ttf: http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/

These libraries are optional:

Fontconfig: http://www.fontconfig.org/release/

Basic Installation
==================

`cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and run:

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
# make install

This will install game binary as /usr/bin/syobon and game data files under
/usr/share/open-syobon. If you have libfontconfig installed game will search
for sazanamy-gothic.ttf in default system font path; you can override this
behaviour to use builtin font, you also can install icon and desktop entry
files (see output of `configure --help' for instructions).

To remove game run:
# make uninstall
